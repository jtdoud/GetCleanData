# Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
### Tucker Doud

This repo contains my submission for the Johns Hopkins Universtiy *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project. The repo includes:

1. This README file;
2. A well commented data processing script named **run_analysis.R**;
3. A code book for the new tidy dataset; and
4. The new tidy data set produced by the script above called **tidy_data.txt**

## Review Criteria

1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

## Instructions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
